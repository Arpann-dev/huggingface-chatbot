# 🤖 Hugging Face Chatbot

This project showcases a basic chatbot built using the Hugging Face `transformers` library. It runs entirely on Google Colab and leverages a pre-trained language model to generate conversational responses.

## 📌 Features
- Uses Hugging Face Transformers for natural language interaction.
- Runs in Google Colab — no setup needed.
- Simple code structure for easy experimentation.

## 🧠 Model
This chatbot uses a pre-trained model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library. You can customize it to use other conversational models from the Hugging Face Model Hub.

## 📁 Files
- `HuggingFace_Chatbot.ipynb` — Notebook containing the chatbot implementation.

## 🛠 Technologies
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Run each cell in order to initialize the model.
3. Interact with the chatbot by entering your inputs in the input cell.
